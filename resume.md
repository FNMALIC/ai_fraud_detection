# Mobile Money Fraud Detection Model Report

## Executive Summary

This report presents the development and evaluation of a machine learning model for detecting fraudulent transactions in mobile money systems, specifically optimized for Cameroon's financial landscape. The final model achieved exceptional performance with an AUC score of 0.9999 and demonstrates robust fraud detection capabilities across various transaction types.

## Data Processing and Feature Engineering

### Dataset Overview
- **Training Set**: 5,090,096 transactions
- **Test Set**: 1,272,524 transactions
